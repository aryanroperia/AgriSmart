# The AgriSmart App

## Overview
The AgriSmart app is a comprehensive solution aimed at optimizing the daily agricultural activities of farmers in the Indian subcontinent region. India has one of the largest agricultural workforces in the world, employing 42% of the country's workforce. Android's share of the mobile operating system market in India is 95% as of 2023. This inherently leads to a large target customer pool for this application. The app offers a suite of features such as real-time weather tracking, detailed crop information, disease management resources, skill development content, and task management tools, all of which act in conjunction to ensure better farming practices are followed. It integrates several APIs and is built using the industry vetted and recommended MVVM architecture for enhanced performance and scalability. This app was made by a team consisting of myself, Aryan Roperia, Arjen Fuller, and Max Bitterman. We were mentored to make this app under Yash Khatri, a current student at IIIT Delhi.
